    "# Introduction to DuckDB\n",
    "\n",
    "DuckDB is an in-process, analytical SQL database. You can think of it as SQLite for analytics (OLAP), not transactions (OLTP).\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of running as a server, DuckDB runs inside your application process - Python, R, Java, C++, etc. and queries data where it already lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What makes DuckDB special\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Built for analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "DuckDB is optimized for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Large scans\n",
    "- Aggregations\n",
    "- Joins\n",
    "- Window functions\n",
    "- Complex analytical queries\n",
    "\n",
    "Think: dashboards, feature engineering, ad-hoc analysis, data science---not user logins or high-frequency writes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In-process (no server)\n",
    "\n",
    "There's:\n",
    "\n",
    "- No daemon\n",
    "- No port\n",
    "- No client/server overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "You just:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import duckdb\n",
    "duckdb.sql(\"SELECT * FROM 'data.parquet'\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Columnar + vectorized execution\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the hood, DuckDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stores data in columnar format\n",
    "- Processes data in vectors (chunks) instead of row-by-row\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why it's fast. Very fast. Often competitive with Spark for single-machine workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reads data directly (zero-copy vibes)\n",
    "\n",
    "DuckDB can query:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parquet\n",
    "- CSV\n",
    "- JSON\n",
    "- Arrow\n",
    "- Pandas / Polars DataFrames\n",
    "- S3 / HTTP / local files\n",
    "\n",
    "Without importing them first.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT avg(price)\n",
    "FROM read_parquet('s3://bucket/sales/*.parquet');\n",
    "```\n"
