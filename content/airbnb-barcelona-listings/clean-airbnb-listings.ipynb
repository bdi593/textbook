    "# Cleaning Airbnb Listings Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "[Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) provides datasets containing Airbnb listings for various cities around the world. These datasets often require cleaning before they can be effectively analyzed. In this notebook, we will demonstrate how to clean an Airbnb listings dataset for Barcelona, Spain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Cleaning Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import Libraries**: We will use `pandas` for data manipulation and `numpy` for numerical operations.\n",
    "2. **Load Dataset**: Read the CSV file containing the Airbnb listings data.\n",
    "   - Sometimes, the dataset may be compressed (e.g., in gzip format), so we will handle that accordingly.\n",
    "   - If the dataset is large but can fit into memory, consider loading a sample for initial exploration.\n",
    "   - If the dataset is too large to fit into memory, consider using libraries like Dask, Spark, or Polars for out-of-core processing.\n",
    "3. **Inspect Data**: Check the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure.\n",
    "4. **Select Relevant Columns**: Identify and retain only the columns that are necessary for analysis.\n",
    "5. **Handle Missing Values**: Identify columns with missing values and decide on strategies to handle them (e.g., dropping rows, filling with mean/median/mode, etc.).\n",
    "6. **Data Type Conversion**: Ensure that each column has the appropriate data type (e.g., converting price columns to numeric types).\n",
    "   - A common issue is that price columns may contain currency symbols or commas, which need to be removed before conversion.\n",
    "   - Another common issue is date columns being stored as strings; these should be converted to datetime objects if you plan to perform date-based analyses.\n"

This parameter is optional if the file extension is `.gz`, as pandas can automatically detect the compression type based on the file extension.
