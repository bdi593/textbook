## 📌 Dataset Information

- **Source:** [`lukebarousse/data_jobs`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lukebarousse/data_jobs)
- **Licensing:** Apache-2.0
- **Format:** Parquet (original CSV file converted to Parquet for compression - no other preprocessing applied)
- **Size:** ~30 MB (~786,000 rows)
  - The original CSV file is much larger (~230 MB) due to the large number of rows and text fields, but the Parquet format significantly reduces the file size while preserving all data.
